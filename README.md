AppAudit
========

AppAudit is an efficient program analysis tool that detects data leaks in mobile applications. It can accurately find all leaks within seconds and ~200 MB memory. We have an Android port that shows AppAudit is efficient enoguh to run as an Android app on off-the-shelf smartphones.

* If you are interested in the tool itself and is looking for the building blocks of AppAudit, please visit [PATDroid](https://github.com/mingyuan-xia/PATDroid). We have open-sourced common Android program analysis code there.
