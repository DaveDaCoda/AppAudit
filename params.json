{"name":"AppAudit","tagline":"Auditing behaviour of Android Apps","body":"### Welcome to AppAudit Developer's Page.\r\nAppAudit is a graduated research project, which intended to check the behaviours of an Android application.\r\nBy behaviours, we mean \"if the app will disseminate personal data to a third-party server?\" or \"what URLs the app will touch once the user clicks on a particular button\".\r\nAppAudit is a general framework where behaviours can be customized and plugged into AppAudit.\r\n\r\nApart from the program analysis flavour, AppAudit is also intended for web integration.\r\nAppAudit could generate a detailed JSON report for examining the app, which could be beautified by the web frontend.\r\nWe are open to the ideas for integrating AppAudit for various use cases.\r\n\r\n### What can AppAudit do?\r\nAppAudit is a program analysis tool to detect data leaks in mobile applications. Data leaks refer to the cases where sensitive user data (e.g. SMS, call log, location) is sent out of the device, to some remote servers. AppAudit features high detection accuracy and low analysis time. AppAudit can run on desktops, servers and Android devices.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the framework itself, please check out our [paper]().\r\n\r\n### Ideas?\r\nWe are very open to any ideas that could make AppAudit more useful. On our side, we are working out an mobile version to run AppAudit directly on Android boxes. Web services will come out soon. And we appreciate your imagination!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can get to me @mingyuan-xia. @iceboy-sjtu and @bblsummer might also answer questions and talk about me with you.\r\n","google":"UA-61168812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
